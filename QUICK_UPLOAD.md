## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Repository already exists"
```bash
# If you get this error, the repo already exists
# Just clone and replace:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart-Code-Composer.git
# Copy your files into this folder, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update project files"
git push origin main
```

### Issue 2: "Permission denied"
```bash
# Use HTTPS instead of SSH:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart-Code-Composer.git
```

### Issue 3: "Large files"
```bash
# Remove node_modules before uploading:
rm -rf node_modules
git add .
git commit -m "Upload without node_modules"
git push origin main
